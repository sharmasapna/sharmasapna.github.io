This is a great way to make a personal website,where you can display your infomation to public, post blogs and make friends. If you are having a self website,projects ,it will benefit you for your interview.
I must thank Jarrekk for making this amazing website open for all. I have made my website by impoting Jarrekks repository.It took me some time to figure out how to make the wesite , so I will be sharing the details to easily make a website which showcases all your projects with your github username.

Step 1: Making a user name in github
	It is important to choose a github username wisely as the website takes the name of username.For example if the name is Abcd and 	the surname is Xyz , we want our user name to be abcdxyz so that our websites url will be "www.abcdxyz.github.io"
	click Your profile> your profile picture > Account  > Change Username 
	Change the user name as desired.

Step 2:Importing repository from Jarrekk's website
	Click on down arrow in the right most corner right to "+" symbol and select "Import repository"
	Type ht url "https://jarrekk.github.io/Jalpc" in the box below "Your old repositoryâ€™s clone URL"
	In Name box of "Your new repository details" enter the name of username as follows 
	"abcdxyz.github.io" (if you want to publish your website as "www.abcdxyz.github.io"
	Note if you give any other name different than username.github.io , then a new repository in that name will be created and the 		website will be published in that directory.For example if you give "test" in the name box of "Your new repository details",
	the address of your website will be "www.abcdxyz.github.io/test. So be very sure you enter your correct username.github.io

Step 3: Click on the repository just created and click "settings" and under the heading "GitHub Pages>Source" select "master branch"
	This is necessary to publish your website in the "www.abcdxyz.github.io" url.
Step 4: Enter into repository directory and edit following file list:

	* **_config.yml**: edit 'Website settings', 'author', 'comment' and 'analytics' items.

	* **_data/landing.yml**: custom sections of index page.

	* **_data/index/**: edit sections' data to yours at index page, please notice comment at each file.

	* **_data/blog.yml**: edit navbar(categories) of blog page, if you have different/more blog page, copy `blog/python.html` and change it to your category HTML file, and edit **Python**, **/python/** to your category name at items **title** and **permalink**, make sure title is the same as permalink but capitalized first letter(except HTML).
